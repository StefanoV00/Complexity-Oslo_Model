complexity_input.py contains parameters that user may want to modify. The default ones
ensure rapid results, which resemble, but not perfectly match, the ones in report. 
The values of the parameters used for the report are written there too, as comments.

complexity_functions.py contains used functions.

complexity_testing, project, bulkh, bulkz are probably self explanatory.
